# Keto-Maniac
The “keto” in a ketogenic diet comes from the fact that it allows the body to produce small fuel molecules called “ketones.” This is an alternative fuel source for the body, used when blood sugar (glucose) is in short supply. When you eat very few carbs or very few calories, the liver produces ketones from fat.
